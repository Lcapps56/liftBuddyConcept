#liftbuddy
liftBuddy is an app that allows users to keep track of ther workouts with an interactive calendar and also 
come up with their own workouts that can be saved and shared. 
#the Calendar
On the __calendar__ page is a calendar with some of the dates highighted blue. The blue dates are ones that have a workout saved onto it. the User can click on any of the blue dates and see the workout that was saved for that date. 
On the __log a workout__ section, users fill out a form for the workout they did and choose the date they did it.
The form will track the muscle groups, difficulty level, the workout, the time started, adn the users satisfaction with the workout.

#the workouts
on the __my workouts__ page is a list of the workouts the user has created. if you click the *view workout* button, then the user can see the workout information saved for that workout. the *delete* button deletes that workout.
on the __create a routine__ page is a form much like the *log a workout* one where the user can create their own workout routine. Information like
1. The workout title
2. The workouts muscle groups
3. The difficulty level

* progress in lifting weight
* workouts hit in a week/ month
* AVG time spent working out
